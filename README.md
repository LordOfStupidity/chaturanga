# Chaturanga
Chaturanga is an ancient Indian strategy game. Chaturanga is first known from the Gupta Empire in India around the 6th century CE. In the 7th century, it was adopted as chatrang (shatranj) in Sassanid Persia, which in turn was the form of chess brought to late-medieval Europe.

# Rules

## Legal Moves

- **Pawn or Bhata**: Moves and captures the same as a pawn in chess, but without a double-step option on the first move

- **Rook or Ratha**: Moves the same as a rook in chess- whereby the rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares.

- **Horse or Ashva**: Moves the same as a knight in chess.

- **Elephant or Gaja**: Moves two squares diagonally, forwards or backwards, and may jump over any piecewo squares in any orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) direction, jumping over the first square

- **Adviser or Mantri**: Moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the fers in shatranj.

- **King or Raja**: Moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no [castling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling) in chaturanga.

## Additional rules

- [Stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalemate) is a win for a stalemated player.

- The player that is first to [bare the opponent's king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_king) (i.e. capture all enemy pieces except the king) wins. In shatranj this is also a win, but only if the opponent cannot bare the player's king on his next turn.

- Pawns promote when they reach their last row (the first row for the enemy). Unlike chess, in chaturanga pawn doesnÂ´t become the piece that the owner wants, it just become the kind of piece that occupied the same square at the start of the game. There is also another limit: the piece introduced in the board must be one of the previously captured pieces; so, it is not possible to have three rooks, three horses, three elephants or two advisers at the same time. The pawns that do not promote stay over the board and may not be moved.
